# Problem Statement

https://dummy.restapiexample.com/api/v1/employees

 

1. Create a parent Component and get response from above API

 

2. Create a child component and pass the data to child component

 

3. show data in table format and Make columns dynamic

 

4. Create two buttons "Ascending" and "Descending" and sort data based on employee salary

 

5. Create a dropdown of age range with age difference of 20 (0-20, 21-40, 41-60). Depending on selection display in table.

                Make the age range dynamic.

                eg: 1. If oldest employee in data is 72 age range will create till (0-20, 21-40, 41-60, 61-80)

      eg: 2. If oldest employee in data is 51 age range will create till (0-20, 21-40, 41-60)

 

6.make a component for api call
